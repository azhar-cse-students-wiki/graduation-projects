# Smart Charger for Electric Vehicles

## Overview
We built a complete wall box charger with a charging unit that has power conversion, power monitoring and protection circuit. The communication happens through Control pilot, which is a communication line, used to signal charging level between the car and the EVSE, and can be manipulated by vehicle to initiate charging and CAN bus that is used to exchange the data between the ECUs. Charging information should be updated to a website through esp8622 Wi-Fi module.

## Technology Stacks and Tools
We used different tools and technology to implement our system like IDEs , Hardware Tools, IOT and Web Tools and Design Tools.
